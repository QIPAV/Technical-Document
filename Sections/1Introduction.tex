\section{Introduction}

This document gives an overview of all technical work related to the project and describes the most important decisions made. Chapter 2, gives a presentation of existing technologies and commercially available components, which are presented and discussed. Chapter 3, contains the mathematical representations of both variable and fixed pitch quadcopters and is used as the foundation for understanding the flight controller, control system and simulations. Chapter 4, presents the concepts of the flight controller, how the code works and all decisions taken related to the code. In chapter 5, the electrical layout and components of the quadcopter are given and described. In chapter 6, the quadcopter concept designs for both fixed and variable pitch quadcopters are given. Chapter 7, contains a detailed description of vibrations and IMU noise. Vibrations have been a reoccurring challenge in this project, the counter measures taken to reduce vibrations and noise on the IMU are discussed in detail.
